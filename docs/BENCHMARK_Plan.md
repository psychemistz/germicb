# AlphaGenome eQTL Analysis Implementation Plan

## Overview

Use AlphaGenome API to prioritize regulatory variants from CIMA immune cell cis-eQTLs affecting cytokine/secreted protein expression.

## Status Summary (Updated 2026-02-09)

| Stage | Status | Actual Output |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Stage 1 | ✅ COMPLETE | 48,627 cytokine eQTLs → 29,816 unique variants |
| Stage 2 | ✅ COMPLETE | 29,816 variants formatted (SNV/indel) |
| Stage 3 | ✅ COMPLETE | 29,816 variants processed (3,713 with non-zero predictions) |
| Stage 4 | ✅ COMPLETE | 1,572 prioritized variants |
| Stage 5 | ✅ COMPLETE | GTEx: 69.6% concordance, **DICE: 78.9% concordance** |

**Note:** GTEx validation was retrospectively identified as circular — AlphaGenome is trained on GTEx RNA-seq data, so GTEx concordance may reflect memorized training signal rather than genuine predictive power. GTEx is excluded from the main study validation (DICE + OneK1K used instead). Benchmark GTEx results are preserved here for completeness.

### Data Location

All outputs relocated to `/data/parks34/projects/4germicb/data/alphagenome_eqtl/cytoatlas_outputs/` on 2026-02-09 (relevant to germline immunobiology project).

### Final Results vs Partial (Plan Written on Partial Data)

| Metric | Partial (Feb 5) | Final (Feb 6) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| DICE concordance | 75.1% | **78.9%** |
| DICE Pearson r | 0.544 | **0.581** |
| GTEx concordance | 64.7% | **69.6%** |
| GTEx Pearson r | 0.283 | **0.380** |

The final run improved over partial results but the core conclusion holds: direct CIMA-DICE comparison (83.5%) still outperforms AlphaGenome-filtered comparison (78.9%).

## Validation Results

### Direct Comparisons (Primary Validation)

**Important**: The strongest validation comes from direct comparison of CIMA eQTLs with independent datasets, NOT from AlphaGenome predictions.

| Comparison | Matches | Concordance | Pearson r | Spearman ρ |
|------------|---------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Direct CIMA vs DICE** | 165,064 | **83.5%** | **0.685** | **0.660** |
| **Direct CIMA vs GTEx** | 68,035 | **68.9%** | **0.370** | **0.377** |
| AlphaGenome-filtered CIMA vs DICE | 4,495 | 75.1% | 0.54 | 0.51 |
| AlphaGenome-filtered CIMA vs GTEx | 1,962 | 64.7% | 0.28 | 0.29 |

**Key findings**:
1. **DICE > GTEx**: Cell-type-specific DICE (83.5%) shows better concordance than bulk GTEx (68.9%), confirming cell-type specificity matters
2. **Direct > AlphaGenome-filtered**: In BOTH cases, direct comparison outperforms AlphaGenome-filtered (DICE: 83.5% vs 75.1%, GTEx: 68.9% vs 64.7%)
3. **AlphaGenome filtering reduces concordance**: May select variants with larger predicted effects that are more context-specific and less replicable

### AlphaGenome-Filtered Validation (Secondary)

| Source | Matches | Concordance | Pearson r | Spearman ρ | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| GTEx Bulk v10 | 1,962 | 64.7% | 0.28 | 0.29 | Potentially circular (same training data) |
| DICE (hg38) | 4,495 | 75.1% | 0.54 | 0.51 | Independent validation |
| GTEx ieQTL | 0 | - | - | - | Coordinate mismatch |

### DICE Concordance by Cell Type (AlphaGenome-filtered)

| Cell Type | Concordant | Total | Rate |
|-----------|------------|-------|------|
| TREG_NAIVE | 349 | 451 | 77.4% |
| TFH | 353 | 457 | 77.2% |
| TH2 | 344 | 448 | 76.8% |
| CD4_NAIVE | 321 | 420 | 76.4% |
| CD8_STIM | 181 | 237 | 76.4% |
| CD8_NAIVE | 346 | 459 | 75.4% |
| TH17 | 330 | 442 | 74.7% |
| CD4_STIM | 189 | 255 | 74.1% |
| TH1 | 240 | 325 | 73.8% |
| NK | 189 | 257 | 73.5% |
| TREG_MEM | 322 | 439 | 73.3% |
| B_CELL_NAIVE | 212 | 305 | 69.5% |

### What AlphaGenome Actually Provides

| Purpose | Useful? | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Prioritization** | ✅ Yes | Identifies variants with largest predicted regulatory effects |
| **Validation** | ❌ No | GTEx validation is circular; DICE validation is weaker than direct comparison |
| **Mechanism annotation** | ❌ No | Only RNA tracks available, no chromatin data |

**Recommendation for paper**: Report direct CIMA-DICE concordance (83.5%) as the primary validation. Use AlphaGenome only for prioritizing variants for functional follow-up.

## Key Findings

### AlphaGenome API Limitations

| Aspect | Expected | Actual |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Track count | 7,000+ | 3 (RNA-seq only) |
| Track types | ATAC, H3K27ac, H3K4me3, ChIP | GTEx RNA-seq only |
| Mechanism classification | Enhancer/promoter/TF | Not possible |

**Implication**: AlphaGenome predictions are limited to RNA expression changes. The 3 GTEx RNA-seq tracks returned are the same data used to train the model, creating potential circularity in GTEx validation.

### AlphaGenome Filtering Does NOT Improve GTEx Concordance

Despite being trained on GTEx data, AlphaGenome filtering **reduces** concordance with GTEx:

| Comparison | Concordance |
|------------|-------------|
| Direct CIMA vs GTEx | **68.9%** |
| AlphaGenome-filtered CIMA vs GTEx | **64.7%** |
| Difference | **-4.2%** (worse) |

**Concordance by AlphaGenome impact quartile**:

| Impact Quartile | Concordance |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Q1 (low) | 65.6% |
| Q2 | 63.8% |
| Q3 | 63.9% |
| Q4 (high) | 65.6% |

- Point-biserial correlation: r = 0.034, p = 0.14 (not significant)
- Higher impact scores do NOT predict better GTEx concordance

**Why this happens**: AlphaGenome optimizes for **predicted effect magnitude**, not **cross-study replicability**. Variants with large predicted effects may be more cell-type-specific or context-dependent, making them less likely to replicate across datasets.

### Validation Interpretation

1. **Direct CIMA-DICE concordance (83.5%)**: Strong independent validation - the primary result for publication
2. **AlphaGenome-filtered concordance (75.1%)**: Lower than direct comparison - AlphaGenome filtering does not improve validation
3. **GTEx concordance (64.7%)**: Potentially circular since AlphaGenome was trained on GTEx
4. **Cell-type specificity confirmed**: Cell-type-specific DICE data replicates CIMA single-cell eQTLs better than bulk GTEx

### Top Validated Variants (Direct CIMA-DICE)

Variants with concordant effects across CIMA and DICE (10,394 unique variants matched):

| Variant | Gene | CIMA β | DICE β | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| chr3:49813942 | UBA7 | -0.39 | -0.63 | Consistent negative effect |
| chr3:40411308 | RPL14 | +0.67 | +0.68 | Strong positive concordance |
| chr2:54560455 | SPTBN1 | +0.54 | +0.79 | Large effect, same direction |

## Next Steps

1. **Report direct CIMA-DICE validation** as primary result (83.5% concordance, r=0.685)

2. **Use eQTL-based prioritization** instead of AlphaGenome:
   ```python
   # Prioritize by significance (89.2% concordance)
   prioritized = cima_eqtls.nsmallest(5000, 'pval_nominal')

   # OR by effect size (89.9% concordance)
   prioritized = cima_eqtls.nlargest(5000, 'abs_beta')
   ```

3. **Consider canceling AlphaGenome jobs** - The running jobs (10659620, 10735825) are not providing value for this task

4. **Alternative use for AlphaGenome**: Apply to GWAS variants lacking eQTL data to predict regulatory effects

5. **Consider additional validation**:
   - eQTLGen (31K blood samples, largest eQTL meta-analysis)
   - BLUEPRINT epigenomics
   - OneK1K single-cell eQTLs

## Conclusions

### Primary Finding: CIMA eQTLs Strongly Replicate

**Direct CIMA vs DICE comparison** (without AlphaGenome filtering):
- 165,064 matched eQTL pairs across 10,394 unique variants
- **83.5% direction concordance**
- **Pearson r = 0.685** (strong correlation)

This is the primary validation result demonstrating that CIMA single-cell eQTLs replicate in independent cell-type-specific data.

### Critical Assessment: AlphaGenome Was Not the Right Tool for This Task

#### Prioritization Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | N | DICE Concordance |
|----------|---|------------------|
| Top by \|eQTL beta\| | 5,000 | **89.9%** |
| Top by eQTL p-value | 5,000 | **89.2%** |
| All variants | 19,655 | 82.2% |
| Random sample | 5,000 | 82.5% |
| **AlphaGenome-filtered** | 4,495 | **75.1%** |

**AlphaGenome filtering performs WORST** - even worse than random sampling.

#### What Went Wrong

The fundamental issue: **AlphaGenome was used to prioritize variants that already have measured effects.**

| What was done | What AlphaGenome is designed for |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Prioritize **known** eQTLs | Predict effects of **unknown** variants |
| Variants with **measured** betas | Variants with **no** effect data |
| Improve replicability | Identify causal mechanisms |

Since CIMA eQTLs already have measured effect sizes (beta), using eQTL p-value or beta for prioritization is more effective than AlphaGenome predictions.

#### When AlphaGenome WOULD Be Useful

| Use Case | Input | AlphaGenome Role |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| GWAS fine-mapping | GWAS variants (no eQTL data) | Predict which are regulatory |
| Variant interpretation | Single variant of interest | Predict mechanism |
| Cross-tissue prediction | eQTL in tissue A | Predict effect in tissue B |
| Novel variant prioritization | Rare/novel variants | Predict regulatory potential |

### Recommendations

1. **For this project**: Use eQTL p-value or beta for prioritization (89-90% concordance) instead of AlphaGenome (75%)

2. **Report direct validation**: CIMA-DICE concordance (83.5%) is the main result

3. **AlphaGenome adds value when**: You have variants with unknown effects and want to predict which are regulatory

4. **Better prioritization approach**:
   ```python
   # Use eQTL data directly (89-90% concordance)
   prioritized = cima_eqtls.nsmallest(5000, 'pval_nominal')
   # OR
   prioritized = cima_eqtls.nlargest(5000, 'abs_beta')

   # NOT: AlphaGenome filtering (75% concordance)
   ```

### Summary

1. **CIMA eQTLs are validated** by direct comparison with DICE (83.5% concordance)
2. **AlphaGenome was not the right tool** for this task - naive approaches perform better
3. **Use eQTL statistics directly** for prioritization (p-value or beta)
4. **AlphaGenome is useful for** predicting effects of variants WITHOUT prior eQTL data
